## GEP_Primary

GEP_Primary is an optional add-on that turns GEP into a primary star system, with Grannus as the central star and Nodens the home world. If GEP + GEP_Primary is installed in combination with GPP + GPP_Secondary, then GPP is added as a secondary star system orbiting Grannus. GEP_Primary is not recommended for beginner players.
